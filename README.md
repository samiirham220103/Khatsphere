## About Khatsphere 

Khatsphere is a project aimed at exploring and classifying various styles of Islamic art, specifically manuscript (naskah), illuminated manuscript (mushaf), contemporary art (kontemporer), and decorative art (dekorasi). Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and tools such as Google Colab, TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib, our objective is to develop an image classification model capable of accurately identifying these art styles from given images. This project not only aids in the digital preservation of Islamic art but also enhances our understanding and appreciation of its diverse styles and intricacies.

## Summary

Khatsphere is an application designed to help users identify and explore various styles of Arabic calligraphy through AI image classification. Users can select an image from their device or take a new picture to instantly discover the calligraphy style. The application also provides detailed information about each calligraphy style and allows users to explore other artworks in the same style.

Khatsphere aligns with SDGs points 4 and 11 by promoting education and cultural awareness through its features. It facilitates learning about Arabic calligraphy styles, contributing to cultural preservation and understanding. By providing accessible information and enhancing appreciation for diverse art forms, Khatsphere supports education, reduces cultural inequality, and contributes to sustainable cultural development in society.
